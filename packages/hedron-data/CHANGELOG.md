## [0.35.0] — 2026-08-13

### Added

- Coordinated Beta train cut for whole-fleet production-grade closure (D-063 / RFC-0068).

## [0.34.0] — 2026-08-13

### Added

- Coordinated Beta train cut for production-grade Gradio client interop (D-062 / RFC-0067).

# Changelog

## [0.33.0] — 2026-08-13

- Coordinated train bump for phase 0.33 (`hedron-posit` unified Posit adapter; D-061 / RFC-0066).

## [0.32.0] — 2026-08-12

- Coordinated train bump for phase 0.32 MCP production-grade graduation.

### Security

- Spreadsheet formula reject/sanitize policies strip leading whitespace, ASCII
  controls, and BOM, and treat fullwidth ``＝＋－＠`` prefixes as dangerous so
  padded formula-injection payloads cannot bypass the check (#169). Tabulator
  ``sanitizeFormulaCell`` stays in lockstep.

## [0.31.0] — 2026-08-12

- Coordinated `0.31.0` train: tooling-grade conformance/sim/notebook/sample-kit/Node+Java evaluators and `hedron migrate streamlit` (D-059 / RFC-0064 / RFC-0061).

## [0.30.0] — 2026-08-12

- Coordinated `0.30.0` train; `hedron-workbench` depends on `fastapi-workbench` 1.0.0 (phase 0.30 / D-058).


## [0.29.0] — 2026-08-11

### Changed

- Coordinated 0.29 train bump.


## [0.28.2] — 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Serialize ``InMemoryDataSource.apply`` / ``fetch`` with an instance lock so
  concurrent nonconflicting commits cannot silently lose updates (#114).
- DataEditor CSV export keeps pending edits, uses RFC quoting (not
  ``JSON.stringify``), and sanitizes spreadsheet formula prefixes like
  ``DataTable.to_csv`` (#112).
- DataEditor save success clears only the submitted batch (by operation id),
  so edits made while a request is in flight remain queued (#111).
  Retained updates on rows touched by that batch refresh ``row_version`` to
  the per-row post-save stamp (untouched rows keep their prior version).

### Changed

- Coordinated Beta patch to `0.28.2` (pin `>=0.28.2,<0.29`).

## [0.28.1] — 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Coordinated Beta patch to `0.28.1` (pin `>=0.28.1,<0.29`).

  inventories (D-056 / RFC-0059): static/Matplotlib beginner charts, optional
  native escape acceleration with `HEDRON_NATIVE_DISABLE` fallback, interactive
  Auto quarantine, and SUPPLY-028 pin/SBOM evidence.

### Changed

  (D-054 / RFC-0057): machine-readable inventory, `v0.25.2` upgrade fixtures, secured
  Explorer evidence, FastAPI ops smoke, and REVIEW-026 security disposition.

## [0.22.0] — 2026-08-08

### Added

## [0.21.0] — 2026-08-08

### Fixed

  portable adapter harness, HDJ manifests/CSP inventory, Celery/RQ bridges, live helpers).

### Fixed
- `DjangoQuerySetDataSource` deny-by-default allowlists when sort/filter lists are omitted.


## [0.10.1] - 2026-08-04

## [0.7.0] — 2026-08-03

- Phase 0.7 portable adapters, operations, and jobs train.


## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-03

- Async `VisualizationSource` protocol and viz row/payload defaults.
- `SQLAlchemyDataSource` adapter (`hedron-data[sqlalchemy]` / `[sqlmodel]`).
- AG Grid Community host shim and `ensure_aggrid_assets()` (`hedron-data[aggrid]`).
- Bounded SQLAlchemy paging: `OFFSET`/`LIMIT` applied in SQL (not collect-all-then-slice).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-03

- Initial `hedron-data` package: data-source protocols, `DataTable`, `DataEditor`,
  in-memory paged sources (sync + async), optional Narwhals dataframe normalization, and
  Tabulator-shaped browser adapter assets.
- Async sources require explicit `page=` at construction; sync `apply_changes` raises for
  awaitable `apply` and `apply_changes_async` awaits correctly.
- Writable-field policy rejects forged read-only/hidden fields, unauthorized deletes, and
  non-mapping inserts.
- DataEditor host: undo DOM restore, insert/delete, save modes, conflict actions, choices
  and boolean editors, escaped selectors; CSS fingerprinted via plugin assets.
